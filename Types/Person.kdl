` The pers resource defines the characteristics of an AI personality – that is,
` a specific person the player can encounter in the game. These AI-people have
` their names (which are also the names of the associated përs resource)
` displayed on the target-info display in place of the name of their ship class.
` When ships are created, there is a 5% chance that a specific AI-person will
` also be created. (obviously, as AI-people are killed off, they cease to appear
