` Spin resources contain sprite info for simple graphical objects. Whenever Nova
` needs to load a set of sprites for a particular object, it looks at that
` object's spin resource, which in turn tells the game how to load the object's
` sprites. Nova sprites are stored as paired sprite and mask PICT resources, or
` as rleD/rle8 resources. The sprites in each PICT are arranged in a grid, which
` can be of any size. The spin resource tells Nova what shape and size the
` sprites' grid is.
`
` Spin resources have certain reserved ID numbers, which correspond to different
` types of objects:
` 400-463: Explosions
` 500: Cargo boxes
` 501-504: Mini-asteroids for mining
` 600-605: Main menu buttons
` 606: Main screen logo
` 607: Main screen rollover images
` 608-610: Main screen sliding buttons
` 650: Target cursor
` 700: Starfield
` 800-815: Asteroids
` 1000-1255: Stellar objects
` 3000-3255: Weapons
`
` It is important to note that the ID numbers of the PICT/rleD/rle8 resources
` are non-critical, as Nova looks at the spin resources to find the sprites, and
` not at the actual PICT/rleD/rle8 ID numbers themselves.

    ` resource).
