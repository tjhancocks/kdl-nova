` A dude resource can be thought of as a container for ships that share certain
` characteristics. Any ship of a given dude class will have that dude class's AI
` type and governmental affiliation, and will yield the same types of booty when
` boarded. In a dude resource, up to 16 different ship classes can be pointed
` to, with a probability set for each ship class. The result of all this is
` that, in other parts of Nova's data file, you can point to a dude class and
` know that Nova will create a ship of the proper AI type and governmental
` alignment, and will pick the new ship's type based on the probabilities you
` set in the dude resource.
